## ✅ Issue 1: Modal Popup Behind User Management Window

**Problem:**
When clicking "Activate" button in User Management, the confirmation popup appeared behind the User Management window, making it inaccessible.

**Root Cause:**
Both the User Management window and Modal component had the same z-index value (z-50), causing a stacking context conflict.

**Solution:**
Increased the Modal component's z-index to `z-[9999]` to ensure it always appears on top of all other elements.

**File Modified:**
- `src/components/common/Modal.tsx`

**Change:**
```tsx
// Before:
<div className="fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center">

// After:
<div className="fixed inset-0 z-[9999] flex items-center justify-center">
```

**Result:**
✅ Modal popups now appear on top of all windows, including User Management, Course Management, and any other overlays.

## ✅ Issue 2: Instructor Confirmation Popup Not Working

**Problem:**
When instructors clicked "Publish to Telegram", the confirmation popup was not showing, and the answer was being submitted without confirmation.

**Root Cause:**
The callback function was being wrapped in an arrow function unnecessarily, causing the async flow to break.

**Solution:**
Simplified the callback passing by directly passing the callback function to `showConfirm` instead of wrapping it.

**File Modified:**
- `src/components/dashboard/InstructorDashboard.tsx`

**Change:**
```tsx
// Before:
onConfirmPublish={(answer, callback) => {
  showConfirm(
    "Confirm Publish to Telegram",
    "⚠️ This action is irreversible...",
    () => callback(),  // ❌ Wrapped unnecessarily
    { confirmText: "Yes, Publish", cancelText: "No, Cancel" }
  );
}}

// After:
onConfirmPublish={(answer, callback) => {
  showConfirm(
    "Confirm Publish to Telegram",
    "⚠️ This action is irreversible...",
    callback,  // ✅ Direct callback
    { confirmText: "Yes, Publish", cancelText: "No, Cancel" }
  );
}}
```

**Result:**
✅ Confirmation popup now appears when instructor clicks "Publish to Telegram"
✅ Answer is only submitted after user confirms with "Yes, Publish"
✅ User can cancel the action with "No, Cancel"

## ✅ Issue 3: Telegram Message in Arabic

**Problem:**
Telegram messages contained English and French words like "Question:", "Answer:", "Connection test successful!", etc.

**Requirement:**
All Telegram messages should be completely in Arabic, with no English or French words.

**Solution:**
Modified the Telegram message formatting to use Arabic labels and text.

**File Modified:**
- `src/services/telegram.ts`

**Changes:**

### 1. Message Format:
```tsx
// Before:
❓ <b>Question:</b>
${question.questionText}

✅ <b>Answer:</b>
${answer}

// After:
❓ <b>السؤال:</b>
${question.questionText}

✅ <b>الإجابة:</b>
${answer}
```

### 2. Test Connection Message:
```tsx
// Before:
const testMessage = '✅ Connection test successful!';

// After:
const testMessage = '✅ تم الاتصال بنجاح!';
```

**Result:**
✅ All Telegram messages now use Arabic labels
✅ "Question:" → "السؤال:"
✅ "Answer:" → "الإجابة:"
✅ "Connection test successful!" → "تم الاتصال بنجاح!"
✅ Chapter and lesson titles remain as they are in the course structure
✅ Emojis (📚, 📖, ❓, ✅, ⏰) are preserved for visual clarity

**Example Telegram Message:**
```
📚 الفصل الأول
📖 الدرس الأول

❓ السؤال:
ما هو تعريف البرمجة؟

✅ الإجابة:
البرمجة هي عملية كتابة التعليمات...

⏰ 2024-01-15 - 14:30
```
